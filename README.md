## What is Western States?

The Western States endurance run is a 100 mile trail run. Originally, Western States was a horse race (in fact, the horse race still takes place every year). The foot race started in 1974 when Gordy Ainsleigh's horse was unable to start, so Gordy decided to do the race on foot. He completed the race in 23 hours and 42 minutes. 

There is now a 30 hour cut off time, which means if you do not complete the race within the 30 hour time limit, you will not be an official finisher of the Western States Endurance Race.

There are three ways to toe the line at Western States:
1) Be one of the top ten males or females in last year's race.
2) Be the top two males or females in one of the 5 qualifier races that take place throughout the year.
3) The Western States Lottery. 

The 2021 race wrapped up recently and it was a record breaker! In the overall top 20, 9 of them were female and all of the top 20 crossed the finish line sub-20 hours. The overall winner, Jim Walmsley finished in 14 hours 46 minutes, 1 second (which isn't the record... though he owns the record as well, having finished in 14 hours 9 minutes, 28 seconds in 2019). The female winner (and 7th place overall), Beth Pascall, finished in 17 hours 10 minutes, 42 seconds.

## Inquiry(ies)

Is this historic number of women in the overall top 20 a fluke or the by product of something else? I will analyze the historical data to determine whether this record may be trending towards being broken again, and if so, why? If there is a history of an increase in the number of women in the overall top 20, is this merely a byproduct of an increase in female participants or are there additional factors at play? 

## Project Plan (simplified)
1) Use Python to scrape the data from the Western States website
2) Initial cleaning (if necessary) and analysis with R
3) Create visuals with R or Tableau (undecided)
